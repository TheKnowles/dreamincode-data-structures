There appears to be a bug in the right left case.
Insertion order: 10 9 15 11 17 12

after rotation, 12 is missing from the list?
found bug, 12 gets killed in rotateRight lines 247-248

attempts to rotate right on the subtree rooted at 15
assigns new root of 11 and assigns 11 as new right child

fix is to assign 12/node as 15's left child

Bug in deletion of non root two children. Left child of node to delete is dangled.
Do not reassign ptr. If swap node has a subtree, it goes under original node marked
for deletion's left child.

Part II released, everything looks good.
