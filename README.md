# dreamincode-data-structures

This project is a simplified collection of the misc. data structures I've blogged about.

Going back years later to add a feature would be much easier with a single location.


Included structures:

Binary Search Tree

Linked List

Binary Heap

Huffman Encoding (usage of Binary Heap)

Data structures that had their own project prior to this one:

AVL Tree: https://github.com/TheKnowles/avl_tree_tutorial


All folders include the code with a sample main.
