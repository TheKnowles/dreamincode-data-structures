# dreamincode-data-structures

This project is a simplified collection of the misc. data structures I've blogged about.

Going back years later to add a feature would be much easier with a single location.


Included structures:

AVL Tree

Binary Heap

Binary Search Tree

Huffman Encoding (usage of Binary Heap)

Linked List

Radix Tree

Trie

Maximum Common Range of k Intervals Given N Intervals


All folders include the code with a sample main.
